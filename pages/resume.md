B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering, Oct. 2019 - June 2023 <br>
GPA: 3.49/4

## Work Experience

### Udemy
Software Engineer Intern, June 2022 - May 2023

- Part of the Machine Learning Platform team, a team of engineers with different backgrounds and dedicated to build, operate scalable systems, platforms, and tools to enable the development and productionization of Machine Learning applications. The platform serves to 6 teams, and 70 users.
- Implemented Machine Learning pipelines that processed data with **Spark**, executed within **SageMaker**, and orchestrated with **Airflow**.
- Co-led integration of a data catalog tool, **Datahub**, resulting in improved governance, visibility, and lineage of artifacts generated within the Machine Learning platform.
- Co-led **Model Registry** project to store Machine Learning models in a centralized place. Organized and led meetings with downstream teams, users, and different vendors. Documented every investigation, experiment and outcome.
- • Implemented unit tests with **pytest**, and **Github Actions** workflows in CI/CD processes to manage integration and the deployment of new images into **Amazon ECR**. Used **Terraform** to manage the resources within the platform.
- Actively participated in a Machine Learning Operations (**MLOps**) study club, strengthening knowledge of core components of Machine Learning platforms such as Feature Stores, Model Registries, and Experiment Tracking tools.

### SOMERA
Software Engineer, August 2021 - June 2022

- • Refactored the company’s data enrichment pipeline into a **Kafka**-based structure, resulting in improved scalability and reliability.
- Integrated **Deep Learning** based text enhancement methods such as sentiment analysis and text categorization into the company’s new data enrichment pipeline.
- Developed a **Turkish Image Captioning** project using Data-centric AI practices, resulting in a **Flask**-based prototype containerized with Docker.

[Github Link](https://github.com/badayvedat/hacettepe-precipitation-forecast)

- Collaborated with a team of 3 to optimize model performance and interpretability.
- Trained a logistic regression model using **scikit-learn**, achieving 78% accuracy on the test set.
- Preprocessed and analyzed data using **Numpy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

### Chip8 Emulator
[Github Link](https://github.com/badayvedat/chip8-emulator)

- Chip-8 is a simple, interpreted, programming language which was first used on some do-it-yourself computer systems in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
- Integrated keyboard and sound support using **SDL2** and **SDL2_Mixer**.
- Developed a Parser for a custom config file to set various emulator parameters, such as RGB supported color, refresh rate, and scale rate.

## Extracurricular Activity
