# 7x7 Rule for Designing Presentations

2023-06-13

7x7 rule is a simple guideline for designing presentations. The rule says that for each slide in the presentation, you should use at most:
- 7 lines per slide
- 7 words per line

The rule aims to decrease the amount of information a slide may contain, and focus more on story telling. This would also help in cases where the presentation becomes a "slide reading" session.

What I like most about the rule is that it will:
- Decrease the amount of time I spent on designing a presentation.
- Help me focus on story telling instead of reading through the slide.
- Remove the unnecessary points, and keep the essential ones.

The rule can be made stricter by adding another 7 to limit the maximum number of slides in a presentation.

Additionally, there are other rules such as 6x6 and 5x5 that follow similar guidelines but with fewer slides and lines.
